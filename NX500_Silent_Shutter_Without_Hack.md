#NX500 - Enable Silent Shutter Without Hack

###NOTE: This only works on NX500 at SINGLE frame shooting (not with CONTINUOUS). See [here](https://github.com/ottokiksmaler/nx500_nx1_modding/blob/master/NX500%20Silent%20shooting.md)

This tool is useful to enable silent (full electronic) shooting on your own camera if you don't want to hack it.

u will need a spare SD card for this (any card, size is not important, you can reuse the card afterwards).

Instructions:
  - Download this ZIP file: [nx500silent.zip](https://github.com/ottokiksmaler/nx500_nx1_modding/blob/master/nx500silent.zip?raw=true)
  - Unpack it to some spare SD card (so that there is a file **info.tg** on the root directory of the SD card, for example, the file ```E:\info.tg``` exists)
  - Put the SD card in the camera
  - Power on the camera
  - Wait a bit
  - That's it - now you should have silent shooting enabled

###IMPORTANT - This SD card will start the camera in *"Factory mode"* that has limited touchscreen (and other) functionality.
