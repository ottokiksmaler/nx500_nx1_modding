#Enable screenshot functionality

**This is a very simple non-destructive "hack" that you can safely try.**

If you want to take a screenshot of your camera screen put a file named **save_screen_enable.txt** in the SD card root and every time you press EXP+OK a file named **OSD####.jpg** will be saved to SD card root. 

File **save_screen_enable.txt** will contain the integer of next image id (as bytes, not text).
